The project could be classified as hardware, software, modeling, simulation etc. The project should involve one or many elements of techniques such as analysis, design, synthesis.<br>
 
<b>The department will appoint a project coordinator who will coordinate the following:</b><br>
 
Grouping of students (maximum of 3 in a group) Allotment of projects and project guides.<br>
Project monitoring at regular intervals.<br>
 
All projects allotment is to be completed by the 4th week of 4th year 1st semester so that the students get sufficient time for completion of the project.<br>
 
All projects will be monitored at least twice in a semester through student presentations. Sessional marks are to be based on the Grades/ Marks, awarded by a monitoring committee comprising of faculty members as well as by the supervisor.<br>
