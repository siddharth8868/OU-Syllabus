    Solving a real life problem should be the focus of under graduate projects. Faculty members should prepare project briefs (giving scope and reference) well
    in advance which should be made available to the students at the departmental library. The project may be classified as hardware / software / modeling /
    simulation. It may comprise any elements such as analysis, design, synthesis.
</p>
<p>
    The department will appoint a project coordinator who will coordinate the following:
</p>
<p>
    1) Grouping of students (a maximum of 3 in a group).
</p>
<p>
    2) Allotment of projects and project guides.
</p>
<p>
    3) Project monitoring at regular intervals.
</p>
<p>
    All projects allotments are to be completed by the 4th week of IV year 1st semester, so that students get sufficient time for completion of the project.
</p>
<p>
    All projects will be monitored at least twice in a semester through students presentation. Sessional marks should be based on the grades / marks, awarded
    by a monitoring committee of faculty as also marks given by the supervisor.
</p>
<p>
    Efforts be made that some of the projects are carried out in industries with the help of industry coordinators. Problems can also be invited from the
    industries to be worked out through undergraduate projects.
</p>
<p>
    Common norms will be established for final documentation of the project report by the respective department.
