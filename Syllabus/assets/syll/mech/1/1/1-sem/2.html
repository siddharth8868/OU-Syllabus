  <p>
  <b>Instruments and their use:</b> Lettering and various types of lines, scales, reduced and enlarged scales, representative fraction, types of scales plain, diagonal and vernier. <br>
<b>Geometrical construction:</b> Construction of regular polygons inscribed in a circle, given the side of the polygon.<br> 
<b>Curves in engineering practice:</b> Construction of engineering curves such as ellipse, parabola, hyperbola, cycloid, epicycloid, hypocycloid and involute.

  <p>
  <b>Projections of points and straight lines :</b> Points placed in different quadrants, projections of straight lines, parallel to one or both the reference planes and contained by one or both the reference planes, perpendicular to one and inclined to the other and inclined to both the reference planes, and traces. <br>
<b>Projections of planes:</b> Perpendicular planes, traces of planes, oblique planes and auxiliary planes.
