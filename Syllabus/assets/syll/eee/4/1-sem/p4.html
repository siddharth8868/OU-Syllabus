    Oral presentation is an important aspect of Engineering education. The objective of the Seminar is to prepare the student for a systematic and independent
    study of the state of the art topics in a broad area of his/ her specialization.
</p>
<p>
    Seminar topics may be chosen by the students with advice from the faculty members. Students are to be exposed to following aspects of a Seminar
    presentation.
</p>
<p>
    * Literature survey
</p>
<p>
    * Organization of the material
</p>
<p>
    * Presentation of OHP slides / PC presentation
</p>
<p>
    * Technical writing
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Each student is required to:</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Submit a one page synopsis before the Seminar talk for display on the notice board.
</p>
<p>
    2. Give a 20 minutes presentation through OHP or PC or Slide projector followed by a 10 minutes discussion.
</p>
<p>
    3. Submit a report on the seminar topic with list of references and slides used.
</p>
