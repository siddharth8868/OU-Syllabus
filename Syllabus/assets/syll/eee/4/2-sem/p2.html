    ‘Solving the Real Life Problem’ should be the focus of U.G. Project. Faculty members should prepare the Project brief well in advance, which should be made
    available to the students at the Departmental library. The Project may be classified as hardware, software, modeling and simulation. It should involve one
    or many elements of techniques such as analysis, design, synthesis etc.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>The Department will appoint a Project co-coordinator who will coordinate the following:</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Grouping of students(a maximum of three in a group) Allotment of Projects and Project guides
</p>
<p>
    Project monitoring at regular intervals
</p>
<p>
    All Project allotments are to be completed by 4<sup>th</sup> week of IV year 1<sup>st</sup> Semester so that students get sufficient time for completion of
    the Project.
</p>
<p>
    All Projects will be monitored at least twice in a semester through students presentation. Sessional marks should be based on the grades/ marks, awarded by
    a monitoring committee of faculty members and marks given by the supervisor.
</p>
<p>
    Efforts should be made that some of the Projects are carried out in Industries with the help of Industry co-coordinators. Problems can also be invited from
    the Industries to be worked out through U.G. Project.
</p>
<p>
    Common norms will be established for final documentation of the Project report by the respective Department.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>*Excellent / Very Good / Good / Satisfactory / Unsatisfactory.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note : </strong>
    Three periods of contact load will be assigned to each Project<strong> </strong>guide.
