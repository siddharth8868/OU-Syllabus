        Dealing with a real time problem should be the focus of under graduate project.
    </p>
    <p>
        Faculty members should prepare project briefs (giving scope and references) well in advance, which should be made available to the students in the
        department.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project may be classified as hardware / software modeling / simulation. It may comprise any or all elements such as analysis, design and synthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>The department should appoint a project coordinator who will coordinate the following.</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Grouping of students ( a maximum of 3 in group ) Allotment of projects and project guides
    </p>
    <p>
        Project monitoring at regular intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
        All project allotment are to be completed by the 4<sup>th</sup> week of IV– Year, I-Semester, so that the students get sufficient time for completion
        of the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        All projects will be monitored at least twice in a semester through individual presentations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every student should maintain a project dairy, wherein he/she needs to record the progress of his/her work and get it signed at least once in a week by
        the guide(s). If working outside and college campus, both the external and internal guides should sign the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sessional marks should be based on the grades / marks, awarded by a monitoring project committee of faculty members as well as the marks given by the
        guide.
    </p>
    <p>
        Efforts be made the some of the projects are carried out in reputed industries / research organizations with the help of industry coordinators.
        Problems can also be invited from the industries to be worked out through undergraduate projects.
    </p>
    <br clear="all"/>
    <p>
        Common norms should be established for final documentation of the project report by the respective department on the following lines:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. The project little should be task oriented for example “Analysis and Modeling of ………..”
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Objectives of the project should be identified clearly and each student of the project batch should fulfill at least one of the objectives
        identified. The chapters of the project report should reflect the objectives achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Contents of the report should include the following
    </p>
    <p>
        a. Title page
    </p>
    <p>
        b. Certificate
    </p>
    <p>
        c. Acknowledgements
    </p>
    <p>
        d. Abstract (limited to one/two paragraphs, page no.1 should start from this)
